    maxEntriesLocalDisk –
           The maximum sum total number of elements (cache entries) allowed on the disk tier for a cache.
           If this target is exceeded, eviction occurs to bring the count within the allowed target.
           The default value is 0, which means no eviction takes place (infinite size is allowed).
           A seing of 0 means that no eviction of the cache's entries takes place, and consequently
           can cause the node to run out of disk space.

    eternal -
                If the cache's eternal flag is set, it overrides any finite TTI/TTL values that have been set.
                Individual cache elements may also be set to eternal. Eternal elements and caches do not expire, however
                they may be evicted

   timeToLiveSeconds -
                  The maximum number of seconds an element can exist in the cache regardless of use.
                  The element expires at this limit and will no longer be returned from the cache.
                  The default value is 0, which means no timeToLive (TTL) eviction takes place (infinite lifetime).

    timeToIdleSeconds -
                The maximum number of seconds an element can exist in the cache without being accessed.
                The element expires at this limit and will no longer be returned from the cache.
                The default value is 0, which means no timeToIdle (TTI) eviction takes place (infinite lifetime).

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy -
                MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy aribute specified in the configuration file. Legal values are
                LRU (default), LFU and FIFO:

            Least Recently Used (LRU)—LRU is the default seing. The last-used timestamp is
            updated when an element is put into the cache or an element is retrieved from the
            cache with a get call.

            Least Frequently Used (LFU) —For each get call on the element the number of hits is
            updated. When a put call is made for a new element (and assuming that the max
            limit is reached for the memory store) the element with least number of hits, the Less
            Frequently Used element, is evicted.

            First In First Out (FIFO) — Elements are evicted in the same order as they come in.
            When a put call is made for a new element (and assuming that the max limit is
            reached for the memory store) the element that was placed first (First-In) in the store
            is the candidate for eviction (First-Out).
